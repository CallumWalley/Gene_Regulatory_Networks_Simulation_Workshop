This advanced workshop is an introduction to the stochastic simulation of Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) using the R package `sismonr`. You will learn the basics of simulating GRNs, and how to scale up simulations on a HPC.

## Pre-workshop information

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with bash and R
- Basic molecular biology knowledge preferred (gene expression and regulation)
- HPC knowledge preferred
