## Why simulations are important in research

<br />

> **Model**: mathematical or statistical representation of a system or phenomenon (cell, ecosystem, solar system, etc).

<br />

> **Simulation**: Data about the system generated using a mathematical or statistical model.

## Why simulations are important in research

Models and simulations allow us to:

* Explain experimental data (through model fitting and refinement);

--

* Test hypotheses:
  - without going through expensive and time-consuming experiments;
  - that wouldnâ€™t be ethical or even feasible to test in real life:
  
--

* Make predictions about new interventions/scenarios;

--

* Communicate knowledge.

## Why simulations are important in research

Modelling and simulations are used in many fields of science, e.g.:

* **Epidemiology**: modelling of infectious diseases (see this [talk on COVID-19 modelling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhECexc9jt4));

--
 
* **Ecology**: modelling of ecosystems, prediction of species abundance, evaluation of conservation policies;

--

* **Medicine**: construction of organ models, prediction of drug-target binding and drug efficiency;

--

* **Chemistry**, molecular biology: molecules interaction models;

--

* **Astrophysics**: modelling of planet formation, galaxy mergers (see [this example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcDtJ_-jdMw));

--

* and many more!
